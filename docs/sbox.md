## *sbox* 

Run program in sandbox

```bash
sbox [OPTION] PROGRAM
```

### Sample Usages:

```bash
# run program in a privileged sandbox
sbox apt install curl

# run program in sandbox as unprivileged user 'shawwwn'
sbox -u shawwwn bash

# run bash in sandbox named 'sandbox1'
sbox -n sandbox1 bash

# run htop in 'sandbox1', monitor processes in sandbox
sbox -n sandbox1 --join htop

# blacklist syscall uanme() in sandbox
# running program 'uname' or 'sleep' inside sandbox will result in "Operation not permitted"
sbox --seccomp-blacklist "uname,nanosleep" bash 

# drop capability CAP_NET_RAW in sandbox
# you will not be able to 'ping' inside sandbox
sbox --cap-drop "CAP_NET_RAW" bash

# Apply sandbox process with cgroup controller 'cpuset,memory:foo' and 'cpu:boo'
sbox -g cpuset,memory:foo -g cpu:boo bash
```

### OPTION:

* **-n | --container-name NAME**
    
    Name of the sandbox.\
    For identify different sandbox environments. \
    A environment is basically a overlay filesystem on top your existing rootfs.\
    Several working directories will be created under `/tmp/sbox/NAME/`. \
    Default: 'default'
    
* **-u | --user-root USER** 
    
    Still need root to do initialization. \
    Once initialization is done, enter *user namespace* as user `USER`.\
    Finally, map `USER`'s uid to root inside sandbox.\
    Program(s) run inside our sandbox will appear to be running as root but in fact only has `USER`'s privilege.\
    Default: 'root'
    
* **-d | --snapshot-dir DIR** 
    
    Path of the snapshot directory storing **commited** file system changes after `PROGRAM` exits from sandbox.\
    Default: 'snapshot'    # relative path inside /tmp/sbox/NAME/
    
* **-B | --seccomp-blacklist SYSCALLS**
    
    Deny syscalls that are in list SYSCALLS inside sandbox via `seccomp`.\
    List SYSCALLS has a format of `'syscall1,syscall2,syscall3'` (no space in between function names).\
    Please refer to *Note* section for default syscall blacklist.
    
* **-D | --cap-drop CAPS**
    
    Drop capabilities that are in list CAPS inside sandbox.\
    List CAPS has a format of `'cap1,cap2,cap3'` (no space in between cap names).\
    Please refer to *Note* section for default capability drop-list.
    
* **-N | --no-new-privs**

    Prevent sandboxed program from gaining new privileges.
    https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt
    
* **-A --apparmor-profile PROFILE**
    
    Apply AppArmor profile to sandboxed PROGRAM.\
    Kernel must support apparmor.\
    May need to install extra dependencies.\
    ```sh
    apt install apparmor apparmor-utils libapparmor-dev
    ```
    
* **-g | --cgroup CONTROLLERS:PATH**
    
    Add sandbox's main process(i.e., pid 1 inside sandbox environment) to control group(s).\
    CONTROLLERS is a list of controllers and PATH is the relative path to control groups in the given controllers list.

* **-c, --auto-commit yes|no**
    
    Exit sandbox directly, will NOT ask user to commit/merge.\
    If set to 'yes', auto-commit filesystem changes to snapshot directory.\
    \
    NOTE:\
    Setting this flag to yes will not auto-merge snapshot to rootfs.\
    Use `sbox-fstool` or `sbox-mgt` for merging operation.

    
* **-j | --join**
    
    *sbox*'s default policy forbids creating a sandbox when there is one running under the same name.\
    This flag allows *sbox* to send `PROGRAM` into in an existing sandbox environment.\
    Any program sent by this flag will be forcibly terminated(SIGKILL) when the main program exits.
    
* **-v | --verbose**
    
    Print more information.
    
* **-h | --help**
    
    Display help information.


### Note:

- sBox use `OverlayFS` as the "storage driver" (<-- docker jargon). Files generated by your program will be cached at `/tmp/sbox/CONTAINER NAME/dirty`. Upon ***commit***, these files will be move to `SNAPSHOT DIR` overriding any existing one.

- Can not map current user to arbitary user in sandbox. Mapping is no longer do-able using pure shell script because newer kernel doesn't allow updating uid_map/gid_map after 'execve'[(\*)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45972426/unshare-user-namespace-and-set-uid-mapping-with-newuidmap).

- If `-r USER` is not set, sBox will not create custom *user namespace*, so all other namespaces will be children of the namespace the invoking process is in(e.g., shell's user namespace). Do not set this flag if custom *user namespace* breaks your program. On the other hand, if this flag is set, all other namespaces will be children to the newly created *user namespace*.

- Running sandbox inside an existing sandbox will work for the first time; howerever, it will fail if you continue to launch sandbox in a "layer-two" sandbox with errors like 'overlayfs mount failed'. This is not a bug with **sbox** but a limitation(bug?) with OverlayFS[(\*)](https://github.com/rkt/rkt/issues/1537). Currently, OverlayFS can't mount on itself for more than two layers.

- `seccomp` is implemented in C as a bash builtin command(unfortunately there is no way to do this in pure bash). 

    ```bash
    # enable -f seccomp.so seccomp
    # seccomp
    seccomp: usage: seccomp [-a blacklist|whitelist] [-v] syscall_no1 syscall_no2 syscall_no3 ...
    ```

    Default security([seccomp](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html)) profile will deny these syscalls once we are in sandbox[(\*)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/):
    
    `acct, add_key, bpf, clock_adjtime, clock_settime, create_module, delete_module, finit_module, get_kernel_syms, get_mempolicy, init_module, ioperm, iopl, kcmp, kexec_file_load, kexec_load, keyctl, lookup_dcookie, mbind, move_pages, name_to_handle_at, nfsservctl, perf_event_open, pivot_root, process_vm_readv, process_vm_writev, ptrace, query_module, quotactl, reboot, request_key, set_mempolicy, settimeofday, stime, swapon, swapoff, sysfs, _sysctl, uselib, userfaultfd, ustat, vm86, vm86old`
    
- Default security([capabilities](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html)) profile includes dropping these unessential capabilities[(\*)](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/oci/defaults.go#L14-L30):
    
    `cap_dac_read_search, cap_ipc_lock, cap_ipc_owner, cap_lease, cap_linux_immutable, cap_mac_admin, cap_mac_override, cap_net_broadcast, cap_audit_control, cap_audit_read, cap_block_suspend, cap_sys_boot, cap_sys_module, cap_sys_nice, cap_sys_pacct, cap_sys_ptrace, cap_sys_rawio, cap_sys_resource, cap_sys_time, cap_sys_tty_config, cap_syslog, cap_wake_alarm`
