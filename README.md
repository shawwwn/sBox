# sBox
Run programs in a sandbox environment without writting to rootfs.


## Description:
This program is NOT a full-fledge container like docker!
Instead, it is a cut-down version of container, namely a sandbox, designed 
to allow you to run programs without worrying about polluting your rootfs.
You may chose to merge the files generated by your program into rootfs 
once it exits.


## Usage: 

```bash
sbox [-n|--container-name NAME] [-r|--user-root USER] [-h|--help] PROGRAM
```

* **-n | --container-name NAME**
    Name of the container, will create rootfs under `/tmp/NAME` via **overlayfs**
* **-r | --user-root USER** 
    Still need root to mount
    Enable user namespace.
    Drop root privileges to user `USER` before enter *user namespace* so that sandbox will be bound by `USER`'s privilege.
    Finally map `USER` to root inside sandbox.


## Note/Caveat:

- Can not map current user to arbitary user in sandbox. Mapping is no longer do-able using pure shell script because newer kernel doesn't allow updating uid_map/gid_map after 'execve'(\*)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45972426/unshare-user-namespace-and-set-uid-mapping-with-newuidmap]
- If `-r USER` is not set, sBox will not create custom *user namespace*, so all other namespaces will be children of the namespace of the invoking process(e.g., shell). Do not set this flag if your program doesn't run well under custom *user namespace*. On the other hand, if this flag is set, all other namespaces will belong to the newly created *user namespace*.
